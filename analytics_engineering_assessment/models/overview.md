# Bitvavo Analytics Engineering Assessment pipeline

One of the ways Bitvavo earns passive income is by staking cryptocurrencies. Think of staking as depositing 
cryptocurrencies in a "high-yield savings account". Assets are locked up for a certain term. In exchange 
for locking up these assets, Bitvavo receives rewards in either the same asset or others as staking rewards.

The data is based on [dbt project folder](https://github.com/bitvavo/data-analytics-engineering-assessment)
containing data related to cryptocurrency staking. The dataset includes information about the 
amount of assets staked and the expected rewards for various cryptocurrencies. 

This models answers the following question:
- How much asset is staked every consecutive day since the first of July 2023 until the current date, 
and how much reward is expected for each of those consecutive days?
